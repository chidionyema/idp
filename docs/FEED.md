🟢 Done: PR #2899 MERGED — /dagster proxy in backstage/app-config.yaml + Scheduler tile on /ops; PR #2901 MERGED — bin/catalog-platform UI_DOORS table wires the same link into the Tools page (layer-dagster now carries an "Open the scheduler" link); PR #2892 MERGED — spec restructured so the two-engine framework (Engine 1 shadow / Engine 2 JIT) is the spine; spec verification doc written (/tmp/spec-verification.md) mapping every artifact to its spec row
🟡 Active: nothing in flight — all mergeable work landed, scratch worktrees cleaned, main is green
🔴 Blocked: W4 glass-break — platform/edge/dagster-route.yaml HTTPRoute so /dagster is reachable over the gateway hostname from outside the cluster (today the proxy targets the in-cluster Service, which works for any browser following the Backstage proxy, but a direct URL still hits 127.0.0.1)
⚪ Pending: founder review of the HTTPRoute; once merged, flip the proxy target from the Service URL to the gateway hostname
🔧 TOUCHES: backstage/app-config.yaml, backstage/packages/app/src/modules/home/Ops.tsx, bin/catalog-platform, backstage/platform/catalog-info.yaml (regenerated), docs/policy/agent-infra-safety-spec.md
🔀 OVERLAP: many estate sessions commit on main constantly; my changes are confined to the wt-dagster-bs branch and one merged spec branch (spec/two-engine-spine)
